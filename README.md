# RSA
Image Encryption using RSA Algorithm 

# PROJECT TITLE

Image Encryption using RSA Algorithm :- The RSA is an cryptographic algorithm which is use to encrypt and decrypt the data. Here we are Implementing RSA(Asymmetric key Cryptography) Algorithm on an IMAGE to encrypt and decrypt using two keys, Private key and Public Key.
To know more about RSA Encryption on an Image read the pdf(RSA Image) that I have uploaded in my Repositiories.

# GETTING STARTED

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites

You just need MATLAB  or OCTAVE installed in your local machine.
MATLAB doesn't offer free version. They just give you free 30 day-trail.
OCTAVE is free. So, here is the link if you want to download in your machine.
UBUNTU : https://vitux.com/how-to-install-gnu-octave-in-ubuntu/
WINDOWS: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html


# Deployment

When you installed the OCTAVE/MATLAB, open it...
Now, fork my project on your github account and Clone/Download it on your machine.
Then, in OCTAVE/MATLAB open that project RSA.m
And , RUN IT... 


# Additional Information
I've Uploaded some C++ Algorithms that are used by me in this code. As everyone is familiar with C++ language so it will be easy for understand. 
Now, in RSA we deal with really big numbers. And every language as a limitation upto how large Numbers can be stored in any Datatype. Therefore, we need a Data Structure to store that Big Numbers. So, here I used Array and all  C++ Algorithms are about doing Multiplications,Divisions, Subtraction and Addition in array. Now, we can find any (Add, Div, Sub, Mult) with no limitations.
